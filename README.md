</p>
<p>
2. Here we can see the newly created ticket and all of its relevant details. It is important to note details such as the Priority Level, Department, SLA Plan and the Help Topic. The Agent can proceed from here and adjust any of these criteria to match the details of the ticket. If necessary the User can be contacted to gain more insight into the problem so that the ticket can be better assigned and solved.

3. Below we can see the same ticket from the perspective of the User Karen-Doe within the Support Center. Here we can see that the User has a more limited view of the ticket in terms of details. They can also send a follow-up message that can be viewed and replied to by the Agent from the Agent Panel.

4. Next, as the Agent, I updated the SLA Plan on the ticket to reflect the nature of the Users problem and added a note to the plan. In this case I chose Sev A which has the lowest grace period, 1 hour, in order to have the issue resolved as soon as possible as it is having a wide impact on the business.

5. Next I assigned the ticket to the Finance team. John Doe, who is one of our Support Agents who is assigned to work Support Tickets, will be the agent working through this ticket.

</p>
<p>
6. Below we can now see a log of the previous changes made by John Doe on the ticket. The SLA Plan has been changed and the ticket was assigned to the Finance Support team.

</p>
<p>
7. Next I logged out of the Agent portal and logged back into it as Jane Doe this time. Jane Doe has also been assigned to deal with Finance Support tickets and has the same level of permissions as John. As Jane I went into the ticket, assigned it to Jane Doe. I then proceeded to message the User to state that there had been a company-wide systems update in the Finance department and that she should advise her team to reboot their systems for the update to proliferate.

8. In the next labs I will outline the process of working through a solution with a User but for this ticket I proceeded to close the ticket once the Users systems were back up. As we can see the ticket has moved to the closed tab of the tickets section.
